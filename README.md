Websites are like sail boats. They require a main haul or backend API. They require a main mast or frontend website. When put together and under the right wind-conditions/user-interations your boat/project can successfully navigate to it's destination. 

Say hello to underwind.solutions: where your project is not just another website; because we treat your project as if it were a high end yacht. We're not as expensive as you might think tho as we only charge per request. So no wind-under-you-sails/user-interactions then no-movement/no-charge. 

Therefore the better user experience we create the more user-interactions your website will get thus the more profit we can both make.
